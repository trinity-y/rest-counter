# rest-counter (file version)

## how to use this program

now, i must explain. 

(by the way, this only works for full bars because, i mean, don't be lazy and count that eighth beat rest okay?)

first, input your tempo (bpm). make sure it's an integer, letters will break it!

next, input the top number from your time signature (how many beats per bar). once again, !!INTEGERS PEOPLE!!!

now, you can queue up all the rests that you have. input the number of bars of rests you have at a time, then press enter. you may repeat this until you're finished. to signal that you're done, enter 'done'!

prepare to play! when you want to start counting your rests, click the enter button, and the program will count!
the program will warn you when there is one bar left and signal you at the end of that final bar.
